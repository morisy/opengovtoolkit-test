## Right Now

**You have the right to request public records in Pennsylvania.** Any person can submit a public records request to any public body in Pennsylvania. You do not need to give a reason for your request.

- If denied, the response must cite a specific exemption
- You do not need to be a Pennsylvania resident to make a request

**Sample request language you can copy:**

> Pursuant to the Pennsylvania Right-to-Know Law, 65 Pa. Stat. §§ 67.101–67.3104, I am requesting copies of the following records: [describe records]. I request a fee waiver or reduction, as disclosure of this information is in the public interest. Please respond within the time period required by law. If any portion of this request is denied, please cite the specific exemption and release all reasonably segregable portions.

## Records Laws

Pennsylvania's Pennsylvania Right-to-Know Law provides public access to government records held by state and local agencies.

### What you can request

Public records generally include any document, file, or data created or maintained by a government agency. This includes:
- Documents, emails, and text messages
- Databases and spreadsheets
- Photographs, audio, and video recordings
- Contracts, invoices, and financial records
- Meeting minutes and agendas

### Key exemptions

Common exemptions under Pennsylvania law include:
- **Personal privacy** — records containing sensitive personal information (Social Security numbers, medical records)
- **Law enforcement** — investigatory records that could interfere with active investigations
- **Attorney-client privilege** — communications between government attorneys and their clients
- **Trade secrets** — confidential commercial or financial information
- **Deliberative process** — internal pre-decisional communications in some cases

The agency bears the burden of justifying any denial and must release reasonably segregable non-exempt portions.

### Fees

Under Pennsylvania law:
- Actual cost of duplication; $0.25/page for paper copies
- You can request a fee estimate before the agency begins processing
- You can request a fee waiver if disclosure serves the public interest
- Electronic records should generally be provided in the format requested

### Appeals

If your request is denied or you receive an inadequate response:
1. You may appeal to Office of Open Records
2. You may file a lawsuit in Court of Common Pleas
3. If you prevail, you may be eligible to recover attorney fees and costs

## Open Meetings

Pennsylvania's Pennsylvania Sunshine Act requires that government bodies conduct their business openly.

### What's covered

A "meeting" generally occurs whenever a quorum of a public body gathers to discuss or act on public business. This includes:
- Regular and special meetings
- Committee and subcommittee meetings
- Work sessions and retreats
- Electronic or telephonic meetings (with conditions)

### Closed session exceptions

Public bodies may meet in closed session only for limited purposes, typically including:
- Personnel matters (hiring, firing, discipline)
- Pending or threatened litigation
- Real estate negotiations
- Labor negotiations or collective bargaining strategy
- Security-related discussions

### Your rights at meetings

- You have the right to attend and observe all open meetings
- You have the right to record meetings (audio and video)
- Agencies must provide advance notice of meetings
- Minutes or recordings must be made available to the public
- Many bodies provide a public comment period

### Enforcement

Violations of Pennsylvania's open meetings law can result in:
- Invalidation of actions taken in improper closed sessions
- Civil fines or penalties against individual members
- Injunctive relief ordering future compliance
- Attorney fees for successful plaintiffs
