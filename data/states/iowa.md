## Right Now

**You have the right to request public records in Iowa.** Any person can submit a public records request to any public body in Iowa. You do not need to give a reason for your request.

**Key points:**
- Requests should be in writing (email is typically acceptable)

I request a fee waiver or reduction, as disclosure of this information is in the public interest. Please respond within the time period required by law. If any portion of this request is denied, please cite the specific exemption and release all reasonably segregable portions.

## Records Laws

- **Attorney-client privilege** — communications between government attorneys and their clients
- **Trade secrets** — confidential commercial or financial information
