## Right Now

**You have the right to request public records in Michigan.** Any person — not just residents — can submit a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to any public body in Michigan. You do not need to give a reason for your request.

**Key points:**
- Requests should be in writing, but there is no required form
- Agencies must respond within 5 business days
- They can extend by up to 10 additional business days with written notice
- If denied, the response must cite a specific exemption

**Sample request language you can copy:**

> Pursuant to the Michigan Freedom of Information Act, MCL 15.231 et seq., I am requesting copies of the following records: [describe records]. I request a fee waiver or reduction, as disclosure of this information is in the public interest. Please respond within the time period required by law. If any portion of this request is denied, please cite the specific exemption and release all reasonably segregable portions.

## Records Laws

Michigan's Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) applies to all **public bodies**, including state agencies, counties, cities, townships, school districts, and public universities.

### What you can request

All "public records" — writings prepared, owned, used, possessed, or retained by a public body in the performance of an official function. This includes:
- Documents, emails, and text messages
- Databases and spreadsheets
- Photographs and video recordings
- Contracts and financial records

### Key exemptions

Michigan FOIA has 13 categories of exemptions (MCL 15.243), including:
- **Law enforcement records** that would interfere with an investigation
- **Personal privacy** information (Social Security numbers, medical records)
- **Attorney-client privileged** communications
- **Trade secrets** and commercial/financial information

The public body bears the burden of proving an exemption applies and must release any reasonably segregable non-exempt portions.

### Fees

Agencies can charge for:
- Labor costs for searching, examining, and separating exempt material (first hour free if the public body has no FOIA procedures posted online)
- Actual cost of copying (typically $0.10/page for paper)
- Mailing costs

The first $20 in fees must be waived for individuals who can demonstrate indigency. You can request a fee waiver or reduction if disclosure serves the public interest.

### Appeals

If your request is denied, you may:
1. Appeal to the head of the public body within 180 days
2. File a civil action in Circuit Court
3. If you prevail in court, you may recover attorney fees and costs

## Open Meetings

Michigan's Open Meetings Act (OMA) requires that all meetings of public bodies be open to the public.

### What's covered

A "meeting" occurs whenever a quorum of a public body gathers for deliberation or decision-making. This includes:
- Regular and special meetings
- Committee meetings
- Work sessions and retreats

### Closed session exceptions

A public body may meet in closed session only for:
- Reviewing an application for employment or appointment (by request of the applicant)
- Consulting with the attorney regarding pending litigation
- Discussing purchase or lease of real property
- Labor negotiations strategy sessions
- Reviewing and considering security plans

### Your rights at meetings

- You have the right to attend and observe
- You have the right to record the meeting (audio and video)
- Meeting notices must be posted at least 18 hours in advance
- Minutes must be available within 8 business days after the meeting
- You can request to address the public body during the public comment period

### Enforcement

Violations of the OMA can result in:
- Invalidation of decisions made in violation of the act
- Civil fines of up to $1,000 for a first offense, $2,000 for subsequent offenses
- Court-ordered injunctive relief

## Tips and Resources

### Practical tips for Michigan FOIA requests

1. **Be specific** — clearly describe the records you want, including date ranges and departments
2. **Ask for electronic copies** — they're usually cheaper and faster
3. **Request a fee estimate first** — ask agencies to provide a detailed fee estimate before proceeding
4. **Keep copies of everything** — save your request, any responses, and fee receipts
5. **Use the deposit strategically** — agencies requiring deposits over $50 must provide a detailed itemization

- **Michigan Press Association** — offers a FOIA hotline for journalists
