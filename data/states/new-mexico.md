## Records Laws

New Mexico's New Mexico Inspection of Public Records Act (IPRA) provides public access to government records held by state and local agencies.

### What you can request

Public records generally include any document, file, or data created or maintained by a government agency. This includes:
- Documents, emails, and text messages
- Databases and spreadsheets
- Photographs, audio, and video recordings
- Contracts, invoices, and financial records

### Key exemptions

Common exemptions under New Mexico law include:
- **Personal privacy** — records containing sensitive personal information (Social Security numbers, medical records)
- **Law enforcement** — investigatory records that could interfere with active investigations
- **Attorney-client privilege** — communications between government attorneys and their clients
- **Trade secrets** — confidential commercial or financial information
- **Deliberative process** — internal pre-decisional communications in some cases

The agency bears the burden of justifying any denial and must release reasonably segregable non-exempt portions.

### Fees

Under New Mexico law:
- Actual cost of copying; $1.00/page if actual cost not available
- You can request a fee estimate before the agency begins processing

3. If you prevail, you may be eligible to recover attorney fees and costs

Public bodies may meet in closed session only for limited purposes, typically including:
- Personnel matters (hiring, firing, discipline)
