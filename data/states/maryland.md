I request a fee waiver or reduction, as disclosure of this information is in the public interest. Please respond within the time period required by law. If any portion of this request is denied, please cite the specific exemption and release all reasonably segregable portions.

## Records Laws

Maryland's Maryland Public Information Act (MPIA) provides public access to government records held by state and local agencies.

### What you can request

Public records generally include any document, file, or data created or maintained by a government agency. This includes:
- Documents, emails, and text messages
- Databases and spreadsheets
- Photographs, audio, and video recordings
- Contracts, invoices, and financial records
- Meeting minutes and agendas

### Key exemptions

Common exemptions under Maryland law include:
- **Personal privacy** — records containing sensitive personal information (Social Security numbers, medical records)
- **Law enforcement** — investigatory records that could interfere with active investigations
- **Attorney-client privilege** — communications between government attorneys and their clients
- **Trade secrets** — confidential commercial or financial information
- **Deliberative process** — internal pre-decisional communications in some cases

The agency bears the burden of justifying any denial and must release reasonably segregable non-exempt portions.

### Fees

Under Maryland law:
- Reasonable fees; first 2 hours of search and preparation free
- You can request a fee estimate before the agency begins processing
- You can request a fee waiver if disclosure serves the public interest
- Electronic records should generally be provided in the format requested

### Appeals

1. You may appeal to Circuit Court
2. You may file a lawsuit in Public Information Act Compliance Board
3. If you prevail, you may be eligible to recover attorney fees and costs

## Open Meetings

A "meeting" generally occurs whenever a quorum of a public body gathers to discuss or act on public business. This includes:
- Regular and special meetings

- Work sessions and retreats
- Electronic or telephonic meetings (with conditions)

### Closed session exceptions

Public bodies may meet in closed session only for limited purposes, typically including:
- Personnel matters (hiring, firing, discipline)
- Pending or threatened litigation
- Real estate negotiations

- Attorney fees for successful plaintiffs
