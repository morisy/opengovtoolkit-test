## Right Now

**You have the right to request public records in Massachusetts.** Any person can submit a public records request to any government entity in Massachusetts. You do not need to be a resident, and you do not need to give a reason for your request.

**Key points:**
- Requests must be in writing (email is acceptable)
- Agencies must respond within 10 business days
- Extensions of up to 15 additional business days require written justification
- If denied, the response must explain which exemption applies

**Sample request language you can copy:**

> Pursuant to the Massachusetts Public Records Law, M.G.L. c. 66, § 10, I am requesting the following records: [describe records]. I request a fee waiver as the disclosure of this information is in the public interest. If any records are withheld, please specify the exemption relied upon and provide all reasonably segregable portions. Please respond within the time period required by law.

## Records Laws

Massachusetts' Public Records Law applies to all records made or received by any **officer or employee of any agency, executive office, department, board, commission, bureau, division, or authority of the Commonwealth**, as well as municipalities.

### What you can request

"Public records" include all documentary materials, regardless of form, made or received by government entities. This includes:
- Documents, reports, and correspondence
- Emails and electronic communications
- Data, databases, and spreadsheets
- Photographs, audio recordings, and video
- Contracts and financial records

### Key exemptions

Massachusetts has over 20 exemptions (M.G.L. c. 4, § 7(26)), including:
- **Personal privacy** — records whose disclosure would constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy
- **Law enforcement** — investigatory materials that could prejudice enforcement proceedings
- **Attorney-client privilege** and work product
- **Trade secrets** and confidential commercial information
- **Deliberative process** — inter-agency or intra-agency materials used in the deliberative process

The records custodian must demonstrate the applicability of any exemption and must segregate and provide non-exempt portions.

### Fees

As of the 2016 public records reform law:
- First 4 hours of employee time for search/segregation are free
- After 4 hours: maximum $25/hour
- Copies: $0.05/page (black and white)
- Electronic records should be provided at no cost or minimal cost

Agencies must provide a detailed, itemized fee estimate. You can petition the Supervisor of Records if fees seem unreasonable.

### Appeals

If your request is denied or you receive an inadequate response:
1. **Appeal to the Supervisor of Records** (Secretary of the Commonwealth's office) — they can order production and set a compliance deadline
2. **File an action in Superior Court** if the Supervisor's determination is not followed
3. Attorney fees and costs may be awarded if you prevail in court

## Open Meetings

Massachusetts' Open Meeting Law (OML) requires that all deliberations and actions of public bodies take place in open, noticed meetings.

### What's covered

A "meeting" is any deliberation by a public body with a quorum present. This includes:
- All regular and special meetings
- Committee and subcommittee meetings
- Remote/virtual meetings (permitted with specific requirements)

### Executive session exceptions

Public bodies may go into executive session only for:
- Discussing strategy regarding litigation (if an open meeting would be detrimental)
- Discussing strategy for collective bargaining
- Reviewing character or professional competence of an individual (unless they request an open hearing)
- Considering purchase, exchange, lease, or value of real property (if open discussion would be detrimental)
- Investigating criminal misconduct charges
- Security-related matters

A roll-call vote and stated purpose are required to enter executive session.

### Your rights at meetings

- You have the right to attend and observe
- You can record the meeting (must notify the chair)
- Notices must be posted at least 48 hours in advance (excluding weekends and holidays)
- Minutes must be created and approved in a timely manner
- Remote participation may be available

### Enforcement

The Attorney General's Division of Open Government enforces the Open Meeting Law:
- Complaints can be filed with the AG within 30 days of the alleged violation
- The AG can order remedial action and impose fines
- Civil fines: up to $1,000 per violation for intentional violations
